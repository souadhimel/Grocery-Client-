### Road map:

<ul>
<li>I have created MongoDB as of myself for this project. On the go through of my journey, I used plain CSS as well as Bootstrap. I also extended many dependencies for the smooth go of this project.</li>
<li> I used lots of components (in different folders) in client side with npm installation.</li>
<li>In server side, any user can add, delete or update his/her liking.</li>
<li>ImgBB(for image hosting) & private route were used for the project.</li>
<li>I had to make Email and password authentication by using react firebase hooks and also implemented Google sign in.</li>
</ul>
